# Shipwrecked

## Project Overview
_Shipwrecked_ is a text-based RPG puzzler about trying to get off a desert island. The game was my final project on the General Assembly Software Engineering course and was created in collaboration with ![Preston Ng](https://github.com/sungchun) and used **Django**, **Python**, **JavaScript** and **React**.

I wanted to create a project that utilised a database in a different way so came up with the idea of an RPG. I was responsible for database and app design as well as the writing of the game itself. The project provided a creative solution to a project brief and provided significant opportunities to embed learning from across the SEI course.

## The Brief
- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own frontend.
- Use a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database.
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React.
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
- Be deployed online so itâ€™s publicly accessible.
