# Shipwrecked

## Project Overview
_Shipwrecked_ is a text-based RPG puzzler about trying to get off a desert island. The game was my final project on the General Assembly Software Engineering course and was created in collaboration with ![Preston Ng](https://github.com/sungchun) and used **Django**, **Python**, **JavaScript** and **React**.

I wanted to create a project that utilised a database in a different way so came up with the idea of an RPG. I was responsible for database and app design as well as the writing of the game itself. The project provided a creative solution to a project brief and provided significant opportunities to embed learning from across the SEI course.

## The Brief
- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own frontend.
- Use a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database.
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React.
- Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
- Be deployed online so it’s publicly accessible.

## First Steps
Initially, I had conceived of _Shipwrecked_ as a solo project but, in initial planning conversations with my course cohort, it became clear that Preston was just as passionate about the concept as I was. Our initial conversations also led us to conclude that the game that we envisaged would take both of us to complete within the timeframe that we had. We spent some time thinking about the structure of the game and how it would work in reality, focussing particularly hard on our pseudocode. Finally, we pitched our idea to our instructor who was concerned that we were taking on too much given our deadline. He set us the challenge of building one particular section of the first level of the game - we had to demonstrate that we could get the player to ‘walk’ to a particular area and ‘pickup’ an object within it - do this successfully, and we would be signed off…
